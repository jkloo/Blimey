# Blimey

Plugins and Settings for Sublime Text

## Installation

If you are a git user, the best way to install the theme and keep up to date is to clone the repo directly into your `Packages` directory in the Sublime Text 2 application settings area.

### Using Git

Go to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory and clone the repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/jkloo/Blimey.git "Blimey"

### Download Manually

* Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
* Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Blimey`
* Copy the folder to your Sublime Text 2 `Packages` directory

## Activating

The Plugins and Settings will be active by default. Take a look at `Default.sublime-keymap` and `Preferences.sublime-settings` to see what is available.
